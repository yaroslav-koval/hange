A small CLI soldier that goes hand in hand with a developer. An agentic answer for a routine tasks.

## Development

Shortest way to build the command is

```shell
go install . && hange -h  
```

## Techs

This project is powered by [Go Cobra library](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) that provides the framework for CLI
applications.

## Installation

Hange can be installed by 2 ways:

1. Install it from GitHub repository by specific tag
    ```shell
    go install github.com/yaroslav-koval/hange
    ```
2. Clone this repo locally and install using
   ```shell
   go install .
    ```

## Project structure

Despite this is CLI project, it's created in platform-agnostic way, so modules can be used in other scenarios, like
HTTP, etc.

Some of the modules, like [auth](pkg/auth) contains business logic that is implemented by adapters. Adapters resides
near the main folder, so the structure looks like:

* `auth` - contains business logic and interface declarations of both types: driver and driven. Here resides declaration
  and
  implementation for a driver interface(s).
* `auth/adapter1` - implements one of driven interfaces
* `auth/adapter2` - implements another driven interface

## Tests

Tests are powered by [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) and [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery)

All the mocks stored in directory [mocks](mocks).
Mocks for all the existing in application interfaces can be generated by running:

```shell
make gen-mocks
```
